Go to GraphOne Package :
Storing a Graph : (i). Adjacency List, (ii).Adjacency Matrix ,(iii). Edge List, (iv).2D Matrix(Implicit Graph)

Adjacency List = List of Lists
        0 --> [1]
        1 --> [0,2,3]           We can Store Adjacency List as 1.ArrayList<ArrayList> 2.Array<ArrayList>
        2 --> [1,3]                                            3.HashMap<Integer,Lists>
        3 --> [1,2]


       Go to GraphTwo Package :
       Cycles in Graph :
            Undirected Graph : --> 1.DFS 2.BFS 3.DSU(DisJoint Set Union)
            Directed   Graph : --> 1.DFS 2.BFS 3.Topological Sort(Kahn's Algorithm)
